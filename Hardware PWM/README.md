# Hardware PWM
The objective of this section is to get us familiar with hardware PWM, as opposed to software PWM from the last section.

## Getting Started
This is done by instituting timer modules into our code.

### Acknowledgement
I had some trouble with this section so I used the resources of the internet and classmates to help fill in holes I had in my knowledge and code.
